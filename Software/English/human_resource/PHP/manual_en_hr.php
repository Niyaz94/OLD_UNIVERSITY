			<h4 id="1">Introduction</h4><br>
				This system is designed for Human Recourses department of College of Engineering/Salahaddin University and prepared by students of 4th grade/Software Department as a part of their research project. The system is a web application system will be used to organize work-related activities in Human Resources department. It comprises of two main parts: the first part is for normal users who can only see the information and are unable to perform any actions on the system(details will be provided below).The second part is for HR employees. This part is to perform HR department work-related activities(details will be provided below) and the system is designed in three languages (Kurdish, Arabic and English) that the user can choose a language.  
		

		<br/><br/><h4 id="2">First Part: Log on/in</h4><br/>
				The System is a web application system, in other words: the employee can log on into the system if the device he/she uses should be connected to internet. In this system, the way the user logs on and the protection of information for avoiding hacking is a vital part of  this system therefore we tried our best  to protect the users in case  of any unexpected happenings that harms the user example(seeing information by somebody who is not supposed to see it ). The most important actions of this part is the following:
		<br/><br/><h4 id="3">Log on</h4><br>
				All users who try to log on into the system, They need to have username and password. After the user enters username and password in the logging on part, if the user's name has already registered in the system, he/she can log on into the system and normal employee window will open otherwise the system rejects him/her to log on.
		<br/><br/><h4 id="4">Admission of Username and Password</h4><br/>
				This system is not a general system and all users cannot log in to the system to see the information, only employees of College of Engineering / Salahaddin University  can log into the system those who have already registered their names therefore the employee needs to visit HR department of College of Engineering to obtain username and password.( In the HR part we will shed light on how to create username and password)
		<br/><br/><h4 id="5">First log in</h4><br/>
				All users who log in for the first time, the system requests the user to change the username and password, this change considered to be important for the user, because the password and the username whom he/she received from HR department.
		<br/><br/><h4 id="6">Data Validation</h4><br/>
				It is important that the user uses accurate information in any part of the system to let the system operate properly. There are some rules that the user has to follow before logging in to the system for example, the password should not be less than eight digit or letters, there should not be numbers in the username. the system will notify the user when such errors exist.

		 <img src="../../../image/2.png" alt="photo" class="center-block img-responsive" />
		<br/><br/>
		<h4 id="7">Password Change</h4><br/>
				Apart from the first log in the user can change his/her username and password from password part, , moreover, there should not be two different users with the same username(for example there should not be two users with NIYAZ as usernames), the system notify the user that the name used is incorrect.

	<h5 id="20">Add new Employee : </h5><br/>
	This part is to add new employee into the system. In this part the HR employee has to add information specific to the new employee into the system. The information is of two parts, one part of the information has to be added when the first part of the information is not available, the system fails to add the employee's name, and some of the information will not create problem, if the information is not added.<br/>
	<br/><br/><h5 id="21">Setting : </h5><br/>
	This part is to organize information of the system, the system uses the information of this part to organize all actions in the system and it consists of the following parts:<br/>
	<br/><br/><h5 id="22">Salary Table : </h5><br/>
	This part is to show and make changes in the salary table. The information in the salary table is currently used by KRG. When there are changes in the system, the HR employee can make changes in the table by clicking on the button in each row, a new window will open where the user can change the information of this row(each row is a salary  table grade) and has the following information:<br/>
	1-Basic Salary: The basic salary in any grade (for example the basic salary of grade 10 from 140000IQD will change to 150000IQD).<br/>

	1-Deleting employee's name: clicking on the red button in front of any employee, the name of the employee will be deleted.(this action is very sensitive, the HR employee deletes an employee name when an employee either transformed to another place or retired, because if you click on this button, all employee's private data will be deleted ) <br/>
	2-Data change: in this part we can make changes in the data of any employees after you saved the new data. New data is used by the system.<br/> 

	<br/><br/><h5 id="26">Show Orders : </h5><br/>

	After specifying one month, it brings back all employee's names who has annual allowance in this month. For each employee we can perform 4 actions:<br/>
	1-Deleting:(The red button) this button is used to delete the employee's name in the annual allowance table of the specified month, but if you want to delete the name of any employee, you need to specify the new date of annual allowance of the employee so as to transfer his/her name to the list of another month otherwise you cannot delete his/her name in the specified month.<br/>
	2-Changes: (light green button): when the employee gets annual allowance, pieces of information will be changed by the system for example employee's salary changes and the employee will get new salary.

	<br/><br/><h5 id="30">Service Calculation  : </h5><br/>
	This part is to grant the employee the employment service calculation. First we have to specify the employee name that we are going to calculate the employment service for him/her and then all information related to the employment service calculation will be entered into the system.(the system will not retrieve any information, because employment service calculation will be calculated by Ministry of Finance, and the system will only save information from Ministry of Finance), later action window opens(we will discuss this in input action part).<br/>
	<br/><br/><h5 id="31">Acceleration	 : </h5><br/>

	1-Aknowledgement and acceleration cannot be granted to those employees who have leaves.<br/>
	2-All employees can get a three time acceleration for acknowledgement in one year.<br/>
	3-A group of employees can get acceleration all together.<br/>

	<br/><br/><h5 id="32">Certificate : </h5><br/>
	This part is dedicated to certificates. This part is used when the employee gets new certificate, The HR employee needs to take the following points into consideration:<br/>
	1-Those employees who has a leave, you cannot grant him a new certificate.<br/>
	2-If the current certificate of the employee is higher than the certificate the HR employee(admin) wants to grant it to the employee(user), the system will not take actions.<br/>
	3. The HR employee can only use that certificate where there is in the certificate rules part(This part is a part of setting part, this part is explained earlier)in other words, if HR employee wants to give a certificate where there is not in the system, he has to first add the new certificate in the certificate rules part then he/she can use it.<br/>
	
	<br/><br/><h5 id="33">Leave : </h5><br/>
	This part is to grant leave without pay to an employee, in this part HR employee can see all employees' names who have leave without pay, the duration of the leave, start and end of leave period.(note: When an employee has a leave without pay, he/she will not be granted any service.)

	1-Deleting leave: By clicking on the red button, the employee's leave can be terminated and when the leave is deleted, the system will request the HR employee to enter new date of annual allowance of the employee whose leave has been deleted.<br/>
	2-Change in leave duration: by clicking on the green button, the leave duration of the employee can be changed(for example the leave is for one year, we want to change it to two years), by clicking the system requests the HR employee to specify the year, month and day of the leave.(for example if the leave is for 6 months, in the month part, 6 has to be written, and in month and year, 0 should be written). After writing the information, the system will specify the start and end of the leave. If the HR employee does not agree with results found by the system, he/she can make changes in the results and then save them.<br/>
	3-New leave: by clicking on the blue button, the HR employee can add names of employees to leave table. After specifying the name of an employee that we grant him a leave, the system requests the HR employee to specify the year, month and day of the leave duration.(for example if the leave is for 6 months, in the month part, 6 has to be written, and in year and day, 0 should be written). After writing the information, the system will specify the start and end of the leave. If the HR employee does not agree with results found by the system, he/she can make changes in the results and then save them.(the steps are the same as the second point)
